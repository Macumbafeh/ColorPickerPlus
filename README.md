# ColorPickerPlus (2.4.3 version)
fork of : https://github.com/mrrosh/ColorPickerPlus

Original: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/colorpickerplus

Adds improved features to the existing Blizzard color picker widget. Features
like copying and pasting colors, RGBA channel values, hex value and color
swatches for the old color and color in the copy buffer.

# default feature 

ColorPickerPlus replaces the standard Color Picker to provide

- color specification through a hue bar and gradient box
- text entry for colors (RGB, hex, and HSV)
- text entry for the alpha value (transparency/opacity)
- a 36-swatch color palette that can be used for copy/paste
- a class color palette
- a copy/paste independent of palettes
- a movable frame
- a color swatch for the color to be replaced
- a color swatch for the chosen color

With these enhancements, you can precisely describe a color and coordinate colors within and between add-ons.

 

Left-click on a palette swatch will choose that color.

Shift-left-click on a palette swatch will save the chosen color into the palette.

To switch between the customizable palette and the class color palette, click the button labelled "@".

 

Control-left-click on the chosen color will print the decimal RGB values for the color into the chat window. This was added as a utility for add-on developers.
